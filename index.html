    <h1>Privacy Policy for Codeforces Ratings Chrome Extension</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: 10/07/2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Thank you for using the Codeforces Ratings Chrome extension. This Extension is designed to provide users with the ability to monitor their and their friends' ratings on Codeforces, a competitive programming platform. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect the information you provide while using the Extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <p><strong>User Data:</strong> The Extension collects Codeforces user handles that you input to monitor ratings. This data is encrypted locally using AES-GCM encryption before storage.</p>

    <p><strong>API Usage:</strong> The Extension interacts with the Codeforces API to fetch rating and user information based on the user handles provided. No user data is transmitted to our servers; all API interactions occur directly between your browser and Codeforces.</p>

    <h2>Storage and Encryption</h2>

    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Encrypted user data (including user handles and associated rating data) is stored locally using Chrome's local storage API. This data is encrypted using AES-GCM encryption, which ensures secure storage within your browser.</p>

    <p><strong>Encryption Technology:</strong> AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) is utilized for encrypting and decrypting user data. This encryption standard is widely recognized for its security and integrity in protecting sensitive information.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>

<p><strong>Storage Permission:</strong> This extension requires permission to securely store your Codeforces user data and preferences using Chrome's storage API (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>). This ensures that your information remains protected and accessible only to you within your browser.</p>


    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes encryption of sensitive data, regular security assessments, and access controls.</p>

    <h2>Data Handling</h2>

    <p><strong>Purpose of Data:</strong> User handles are collected solely for the purpose of retrieving and displaying Codeforces rating information within the Extension.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Encrypted user data is retained locally on your device until you choose to clear it through the Extension's interface.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The Extension utilizes the Codeforces API to retrieve user information. Please refer to <a href="https://codeforces.com/privacy#:~:text=Users%20are%20responsible%20for%20any,the%20Data%20to%20the%20Owner.Codeforces">Codeforces privacy policy </a> for details on how they handle user data.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>

    <p><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information stored within the Extension. This can be managed directly through the Extension's interface.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p><strong>Policy Changes:</strong> We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any material changes through the Extension or via other appropriate means.</p>
